# Classic Blog Theme Pack

This is a theme pack for Movable Type and Melody based on the old default "Classic Blog" design, and is also a complete reference example for the Theme Manager plugin.

Four themes are included in the theme pack:

* *Classic Blog, Cityscape*, references many cities (Austin, Boston, Chicago, DC, Houston, Kiev, LA, London, Miami, Nashville, NYC, Philadelphia, Portland, Seattle, SF, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, and Vegas).
* *Classic Blog, Hills*, in four colors (dusk, green, midnight, and pink).
* *Classic Blog, Minimalist*, in several colors (blue, brown, green, grey, light blue, light green, pink, purple, red, and white).
* *Classic Blog, Unity*, in four variations (blue, green, purple, and tricolor).

# Prerequisites

* Movable Type 4.1 or higher
* Config Assistant 1.8 or higher
* Theme Manager 0.9.4 or higher
* AutoPrefs 0.4 or higher
* Custom CSS 0.96 or higher

# Installation

This plugin is installed [just like any other Movable Type Plugin](http://www.majordojo.com/2008/12/the-ultimate-guide-to-installing-movable-type-plugins.php).

Next, use one of the included themes on a blog. There are three ways to do so:

* Create a new blog, and choose one of the theme template sets.
* Go to Design > Templates and choose to Refresh Blog Templates, and choose one of the theme template sets.
* Go to Design > Theme Dashboard and select "Apply a new Theme," where you can select one of the themes.
